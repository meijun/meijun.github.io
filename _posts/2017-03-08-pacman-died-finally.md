After fighting for an hour, our little Ghost killed the eval Pacman. :P

Actually, it's a task in UCB CS188 course Pacman project. In this task, we write a method controlling the pacman to earn more scores. The method in the above screencast is a depth-3 expectimax search with a tricky evaluation function. It's hard for me to get more scores.
